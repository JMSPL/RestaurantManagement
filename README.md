# RestaurantManagement

This project was created to simulate a restaurant software where different people can do different things (e.g. a cook can chose what to
cook and decide when a meal is ready, a waiter can chose a table and register its order, etc). It was used using Vue.js, websocket and 
Laravel for the backend.
